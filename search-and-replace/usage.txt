==USAGE==
Linux:
- only need cambam-regex.py (not any files with "-win" suffix)
- Call in command line (or place in executable folder ... BIN in Linux, ??? in Windows / Apple)
- Pass 2 or 3 arguments:
  * 2 arguments: cambam-regex.py [text-string-to-search-for] [complete-path-to-file-to-search]
  * 3 arguments: cambam-regex.py [text-string-to-search-for] [complete-path-to-file-to-search] [suffix-to-add-to-original-file-name]
- Script will generate a popup asking user to input the **REPLACEMENT** string, and then press ENTER/RETURN

Windows 7 (probably other versions too):
- need: a) cambam-regex-win.bat and b) cambam-regex-win.py (do not use the "cambam-regex.py" file)
- place both files in 'scripts' folder (ProgramData/CamBam .../scripts)
- Make sure the CamBam PP calls the bat file and passes the arguments to the python file (like in the example PP in the "postprocessor-toolchange-touchoff" folder in this GitHub account)
- Use like in Linux instructions above

NOTES:
- Make sure to place quotes around any text string that has spaces in it! (Otherwise, the script will interpret it as multiple arguments and malfunction)
- Adding a suffix as an argument will preserve the original file and create a new, edited one. 
  **Not passing a suffix will OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL FILE!**
- Code is completely commented for ease of understanding and modification
- If there are too many or insufficient arguments passed, or no string is given by the user, the script will popup a box with proper command line syntax for the script, and then exit. **It must be manually rerun.**
