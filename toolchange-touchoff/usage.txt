PURPOSE / USAGE:
- Using a CNC knee mill that has a manual quick-change pneumatic tool-holder. 
- Running LinuxCNC with toolchange enabled.
- Not enough toolholders for all tools used / don't have a way to (or will to!) setup all offsets before running
- What works best is to have the mill return to a specific XY point after a toolchange, move down to Z0, and then pause while operator manually brings the knee up to touchoff
- Operator than releases the pause and script continues
- Therefore, have CamBam produce custom gcode with the toolchange, and prompt the user to input the X and Y coordinates of a 'toolchange-touchoff' point, which is then incorporated into every toolchange in the GCODE file.

"INSTALLING"
A) In Linux
 1. Go to "Raw" in Github --> save as
 2. Save to your CamBam post folder
 3. Open CamBam (or Tools --> Reload Post Processors)
 4. Make sure Python is installed
 5. Make sure the "cambam-regex-win.py" is installed (see it's usage instructions)
 6. Export g-code!
 
B) In Windows
 1. Go to "Raw" in Github --> save as
 2. Save to "C:/Program Data/CamBam ... /post/WhatYouWantThisProcessorToBeCalled"
 3. Open CamBam (or Tools --> Reload Post Processors)
 4. Make sure Python is installed
 5. Make sure the "cambam-regex.py" and "cambam-regex-win.bat" is installed (see it's usage instructions)
 6. Export g-code!

PROCESS FOR CUSTOM TOOLCHANGE TOUCHOFF
- INCLUDED (edit as necessary): Edit the post-processor to include a custom toolchange that included a controlled move to "TOUCHOFF-POINT" and then Z0
- ***YOU MUST DO THIS*** --> Place the script (cambam-regex.py) in "bin" (I am in Linux ... not sure off the top of my head where you'd need to place it in Windows)
- INCLUDED: Call "cambam-regex.py" in the post-build processor command in the post-processor in CamBam
- INCLUDED (edit as necessary): Include the necessary arguments:
    1) the string being searched for ("TOUCHOFF-POINT")
    2) the filename to be edited ("{$outfile}" ... this MUST be wrapped in quotes, because spaces in the filename will malform the command!)
    3) OPTIONAL: text to append to the filename (e.g. 'production' ... so myfile.nc becomes myfile-production.ngc ... and the script CAN handle filenames with multiple periods)
- INCLUDED: When gcode is generated, the script will popup an input box requesting the text to replace with ... input the XY location (e.g. "X-0.5 Y0" ... no quotes!) and press ENTER.
